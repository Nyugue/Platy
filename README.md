# Platy
Yet another dev personnal blog recreating utils that have been existing for decades

## Features TO-DO
- MD -> HTML scripts (cause I'm better off writing information enriched with style than the other way around, I'm no designer) (lame excuse to buidl a woobly rickety tool)
- Github pages (mainly cause it's free)
- At some point add Swarmion template to deploy tons of nice services on AWS (mainly cause it's free as it scales to zero) (but also because I love it)
- Internationalization

## Post ideas
- DRYness in the codebase, function definition and documentation
- CQRS Basics with Event Sourcing - Mb with castore, but most likely home made (cause it's my blog and I do whatever I want) (I may need a Uncle Bob's Clean Coder quote abour devs arrogance)
- E2E testing and the rest of the pyramid blablabla
- Maybe reading notes ?
- Playing with Epsagon and EventBridge integration
- I also need tons of useless projects
